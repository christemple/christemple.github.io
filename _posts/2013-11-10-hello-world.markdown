Just writing some standard text for now and experimenting with Markdown.

Here's a header 1
=================

This is a header 2
------------------

This is pretty neat.

Another header 2
----------------

Just some more text. I wonder what a header 3 looks like?

### Not bad?

	What if I tab in my text? Is this a code block?

    Is this also a code block with 4 spaces?

Ruby code example
-----------------

{% highlight ruby %}
def hello
  puts "Hello World!"
end

hello()
#=> prints Hello World!

{% endhighlight %}

Let's try block quotes:

> One must eat lunch
> before work begins

What is on the menu this Friday?  

* Fish & chips
* Fish & chips
* Fish & chips
* ...more Fish & chips
